Lesson 3:

-Core Audio views audio data as streams of packets
-AudioStreamBasicDescription's describe the packets of a stream

struct AudioStreamBasicDescription{
    Float64 mSampleRate;
    UInt32 mFormatID;
    UInt32 mFormatFlags;
    UInt32 mBytesPerPacket; 
    UInt32 mFramesPerPacket; 
    UInt32 mBytesPerFrame; 
    UInt32 mChannelsPerFrame;
    UInt32 mBitsPerChannel;
    UInt32 mReserved;
}

-AudioStreamBasicDescription's provide data for all packets in a file
-For compressed formats, AudioStreamPacketDescriptions describe the
 data stored in a single packet

struct AudioStreamPacketDescriptions{
    SInt64 mStartOffset;
    UInt32 mVariableFramesInPacket;
    UInt32 mDataByteSize;
}

-For certain compressed formats 3 things may be necessary:
    •AudioStreamBasicDescription
    •Magic Cookie
    •AudioStreamPacketDescription
-The AudioFileTypeAndFormatID is a struct that stores basic file properties.
 When passed to AudioFileGetGlobalInfo(), the function returns information
 about the file type and format described in the AudioFileTypeAndFormatID
-AudioFileGetGlobalInfo() has a companion function AudioFileGetGlobalInfoSize(),
 that gets the size of the information to be returned
-AudioFileGetGlobalInfo can take in a variety of structs containing query info
 but the pointer passed in as the storing place must be of a type that
 corresponds to the query requested
